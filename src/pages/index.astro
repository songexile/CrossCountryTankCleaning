            Regular water tank cleaning is essential for maintaining a healthy and safe water supply. Filtration helps to remove some sediment contaminants; however, filters cannot fully protect your water if the tank itself is left uncleaned. Over time, water tanks accumulate sediment, algae, bacteria, and other pollutants that can compromise your water's taste, smell, and safety. A higher sediment buildup in your water tank creates an ideal food source for harmful bacteria to multiply. Cleaning your water tank helps to reduce this, eliminating sulphurous or musty odours and foul-tasting drinking water. The

            A clean water tank supports the efficiency of your water system. Over time, sediment buildup can clog piping and filters, leading to reduced water pressure and greatly reduce the efficiency of your filtration system. A poorly maintained system may result in higher energy consumption, costly repairs to your water pump, or even complete system failure. By keeping your tank clean, you preserve the optimal flow and pressure of your water supply, ensuring that your filtration system operates at peak performance. This proactive maintenance approach will save you money on repairs while maximising your overall water efficiency.
