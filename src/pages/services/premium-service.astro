  "Our Premium Service consists of the same process as our Standard Service, but with a little extra.",
  "Our Premium Service consists of vacuuming bottom sludge and sediment from your tank, which is discharged to waste. This process typically uses only around 10% of the tank's water, eliminating the need for a full tank refill and saving you time and money.",
  "Following the vacuuming process, we take water sterilisation to the next level. The remaining water is treated with a food-grade sterilising agent that neutralises harmful bacteria and viruses, ensuring cleaner, healthier water. On top of that, we use a ULV fog machine to sterilise all exposed internal surfaces of the tank above the water line, effectively neutralising any remaining bacteria or viruses.",
  "After the sterilisation process is complete we run the remaining water through our advanced filtration system for 45-60 minutes to remove any remaining sediment in suspension. For every job, we use fresh, clean filters to prevent cross-contamination, ensuring the highest level of hygiene.",
  "Our commitment to delivering reliable, professional water tank cleaning services means you can trust us to keep your water tank in top condition, extending its lifespan and ensuring a healthier water supply for your home or business."
