const paragraphs = [
  "The Premium Service uses the same process as the standard service with enhancements, and more emphasis on sterilising and filtering your existing water.",
  "We vacuum the bottom sediment to waste, generally discharging to the edge of your lawn, garden or paddock, ensuring to use as little of your water as possible. This process typically uses approximately 10% of the tank's water. Water wastage varies depending on the depth of sediment, frequency between cleans, tank access, and additionally the type and size of the tank.",
  "Following the vacuuming process, we take water sterilisation to the next level. The remaining water is treated with a food-grade Hydrogen Peroxide-based steriliser that neutralises harmful bacteria and viruses. The remaining water is then filtered through our onsite filtration system to further remove sediments in solution and agitate the steriliser.",
  "We are the only company that replaces our filters at each new job site, thus removing the risk of any cross-contamination with a previous client finally, we use a ULV fog to sterilise all exposed internal surfaces of the tank above the water line, effectively neutralising any remaining pathogens.",
  "Our commitment to delivering reliable, professional water tank cleaning services means you can trust us to keep your water tank and water in a top healthy condition, extending the lifespan of all components in your water system, and ensuring a healthier water supply for your home or business."
