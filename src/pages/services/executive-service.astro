  "Our Executive Clean is designed for tanks that require an extensive and deep cleaning due to excessive fouling on both the bottom and sides. This service ensures every part of your tank is scrubbed or water blasted, sterilised, and restored to optimal condition. For safety and efficiency, this process requires two operators on-site, adhering to strict health and safety regulations.",
  "Typically, we ask clients to have a phone chat with one of our operators before booking an Executive Clean. Often, due to our efficient process, a Premium Clean is all that is required.",
  "The Executive Clean starts by vacuuming bottom sludge and sediment to waste, similar to our other services. We then drain the entire tank completely to allow for a more intensive cleaning. A member of our team enters the tank and water blasts or brush washes the tank's bottom and sides, thoroughly removing any stubborn grime buildup or biofilm. After scrubbing, we vacuum dry the tank and sterilise all surfaces with ULV fog to ensure the tank is free from bacteria and viruses.",
  "Depending on the size and condition of the tank, this process generally takes two hours for a standard-sized tank.",
  "As the tank is completely drained for this service, replacement water will need to be purchased, which can be arranged by either the client or our team. Conditions apply to our Executive Clean due to tank type and ground water levels."
