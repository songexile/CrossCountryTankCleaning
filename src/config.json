  "description": "Ensure Pure, Fresh Water for Your Home and Business Regularly cleaning your water tank is essential for maintaining a healthy water supply. Over time, tanks can accumulate sediment, algae, bacteria, and other contaminants that can affect the taste, smell, and safety of your water. By cleaning your tank, you ensure that every drop is as pure and fresh as nature intended. The Ministry of Health recommends that tanks should be inspected annually and cleaned if necessary. Cross Country Tank Cleaning offers free inspections when in your area, or passing by.",
